# Firestone War Machines Calculator

Firestone is a video game, which has war machines and a warfront campaign, with 90 missions yielding up to 5 stars each.

This application calculates the best team possible given the war machines, and uses that team to calculate how many stars can be achieved with it. The result shows the missions and difficulties unlocked, and the success rate of those missions.

It can also calculate the levels of the war machines required to reach a specific target star, based on an optimal strategy to upgrade them given the resource limitations, and a rough estimation of the time it would take to get there.
